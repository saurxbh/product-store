# product-store

## Overview

This full-stack web application allows users to perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing product data. The front-end is built with **React.js**, while the back-end uses **Express** and **Node.js** to create a RESTful API, with **MongoDB** for data storage. Built a fully-responsive UI that leverages React hooks and state management for dynamic UI updates. I deployed the app using Render.

## Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Users can create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React.js and styled with Chakra UI, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **State Management**: Utilized React hooks to manage product states and dynamic UI updates.
- **RESTful API**: Built with Express.js and Node.js for handling product operations and managing routing.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API requests, ensuring robust functionality.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Efficient data persistence using MongoDB, optimized with schema design and indexing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Express.js and building APIs.
- I used VS Code for development, and Postman for backend API testing. You can choose any IDE of your own.
