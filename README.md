# product-store

## Overview

This full-stack web application allows users to perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing product data. The front-end is built with **React.js**, while the back-end uses **Express** and **Node.js** to create a RESTful API, with **MongoDB** for data storage. Built a fully-responsive UI that leverages React hooks and state management for dynamic UI updates. I deployed the app using Render at [product-store-5rne.onrender.com](https://product-store-5rne.onrender.com/)
